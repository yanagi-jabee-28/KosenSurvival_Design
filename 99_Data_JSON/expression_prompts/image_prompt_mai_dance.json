    "instructions_for_tool": "CRITICAL: Michael Jackson inspired stage outfit - black fedora, black suit, sunglasses, single white glove optional. Show athletic dancer physique even through tailored suit (sharp shoulders, fit silhouette). Body type must be toned and fit, NOT soft or curvy. Pose should be iconic and cool, conveying star power and stage charisma - think MJ's signature moves (fedora tip, pointing, grabbing lapel, moonwalk stance). Expression is cool and intense behind sunglasses - completely different from her usual composed student council demeanor. This is the moment she becomes a stage performer and releases all emotions through dance. Background: concert stage with dramatic lighting, spotlights, colored gels (purple/blue), stage smoke at feet, silhouetted crowd optional. Lighting: theatrical stage lighting with strong contrasts. Do NOT render any text, captions, labels, overlays, frames or borders. Age appearance: 15-16 years old but with professional performer aura."
